#SocialDude -  A Collaborative drawing platform
SocialDude is an online drawing platform that is derived from the very basics of html **canvas** effects. It uses a third party library that enables us to transmit the data from a machine to another.

##Technology Stack
- HTML5 Canvas
- Pubnub Javascript Library
- TypedJS
- Jquery
- Zocial CSS

###How it works ?
A simple canvas effect that powered by the Pubnub library to send and to recieve the cordinates that are send though a channel and is recieved at another end. The function addEventListener(), Which Listens the mouse strokes which then calls the subsequent functions **startDraw(),endDraw() and draw()** makes the magic to happen ! 

###Licensing
All the code that I have written is made under the **GNU General Public License** and the other are upto the corresponding authors.
